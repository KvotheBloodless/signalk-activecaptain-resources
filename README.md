## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

 * Garmin's ActiveCaptain brings together the large boating community enabling sharing of information making boating safer, less expensive and more enjoyable.

 * Signal K is an open source server application that runs as a central information hub on a boat. It centralises data, provides a rich API to consume the data, and is extensible through a comprehensive suite of plugins (such as this one) and web applications.

 * Freeboard is a powerful chart plotter web application that runs as a webapp on the Signal K server.

This plugin's purpose is to bring together these 3 components by making information from the ActiveCaptain API available as resources throught the Signal K server which can then be consumed and displayed by Freeboard as an extra layer of information on the chart.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you up and running.

### Prerequisites

 * A running instance of the Signal K node server with a position source (a GPS).

## Notes <a name = "notes"></a>

 This plugin uses the built-in resources feature of the Signal K server and the data gathered from ActiveCaptain is available to be consumed using the resources API. The resources published under the custom type 'activecaptain' are specifically intended for consumption by Freeboard, but by enabling the "notes" feature in the plugin configuration, data may also be consumed as standard 'note' type resources by other plugins/webapplications using the API.
