## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

 * Garmin's ActiveCaptain brings together the large boating community enabling sharing of information making boating safer, less expensive and more enjoyable.

 * Signal K is an open source server application that runs as a central information hub on a boat. It centralises data, provides a rich API to consume the data, and is extensible through a comprehensive suite of plugins (such as this one) and web applications.

 * Freeboard is a powerful chart plotter web application that runs as a webapp on the Signal K server.

This plugin's purpose is to bring together these 3 components by making information from the ActiveCaptain API available as resources throught the Signal K server which can then be consumed and displayed by Freeboard as an extra layer of information on the chart.
